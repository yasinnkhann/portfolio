This is a clone of the Amazon website! If a user is not signed in, then they are a guest that can simply browse all products, but if they register or are signed in, then they can add products to their basket and checkout utilizing stripe payment. All of their previous orders along with their transaction ids can be seen in the returns and orders page.
