Do you have a baby? If not, do you think at some point you will have a baby? Well then, let me introduce you to Bambino, a mobile first baby management app. Here you can track your baby's health, sleep, and feeding times while also be able to set text reminders for them. Not only that, let's say you're going to be away from your child for a while and you need someone else to watch over him/her. Well then, with Bambino, you can give permission to your babysitter and they will be able to update the status of your baby and you will be able to see it in real time while you're out and about!
