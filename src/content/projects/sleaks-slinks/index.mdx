# Sleek Slinks Fashion

Our team was given the task of creating a portal for an e-commerce website by Hack Reactor as our Front End Project.
The client was using a legacy API for their product information that we were required to adapt to.
Utilizing modern technologies such as React hooks and Styled components, the team was able to create four unique sections
of the page fitting the clients requirements as well as some optional additions:

The main description for the product currently being viewed. It shows all the relative information including styles, pricing,
sizing, average customer rating, quantity in stock, and ability to add to cart. While our team was not tasked with the full Cart service we ensured it was connected properly. The main image can be clicked on for a more detailed view, as well as having access to the rest of the pictures
for that specific item, so as to not require exiting the zoom view and selecting another thumbnail. This greatly improved user experience.

A list of products related to the product currently being viewed. The default image for the product and a shorter summary of information
are on each item card, as well as the option to compare the related product to the currently viewed product. This is achieved by the star icon on each
item card. The outfit has the option to add the current product to a user specific outfit that persists as the current product changes. It is also
possible to remove any product from an outfit.

Showing the first four user submitted questions related to the current product, each question shows the top answer on click. If there are more questions, there is a button to show the next two questions. There is also a button inside each question to view more answers if they exist.
The ability to mark specific questions and/or answers as helpful is implemented as well as the ability to report a question or answer.
There is also the option to add a question and answer, both with the functionality of adding images and required data for viewing.

Every user is able to view all reviews for the current product, an average rating, and option to submit their own review. Each review displays the
reviewer specific rating, the date submitted, and optional pictures. Reviews also have the option to be marked as helpful or to report just as with
the question and answer section. The average rating is displayed as a star rating ranging from 1 to 5 stars. This average based on all the review scores and displays number of reviews for each of the star options. There is also a list of product characteristics that show the average rating for each characteristic. Finally there is also an option to add your own review complete with image handling, required characteristics, and text input.

## Getting Started

1. Download dependencies with:

   > `yarn install`

2. Set up config file in `client/src` and `server/controllers`

   > `client/src` requires cloudinary API tokens and a URL export to endpoint

   ```export const serverURL = 'http://localhost:3000/api'; // Change localhost:3000 to appropriate domain and port. /api is required
      export const cloudinaryInfo = {
        CLOUDINARY_NAME: '',
        CLOUDINARY_API_KEY: '',
        CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET: '',
        CLOUDINARY_IMAGE_UPLOAD_URL:
          '',
        CLOUDINARY_API_BASE_URL: '',
        CLOUDINARY_SECURE_DELIVERY_URL: '',
        CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET: '',
      };


   ```

> `server/controllers` requires github Auth token and cloudinary API tokens too, following the following format

    const TOKEN = 'githubPATtokenHere';
     const cloudinaryInfo = {
        CLOUDINARY_NAME: '',
        CLOUDINARY_API_KEY: '',
        CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET: '',
        CLOUDINARY_IMAGE_UPLOAD_URL:
          '',
        CLOUDINARY_API_BASE_URL: '',
        CLOUDINARY_SECURE_DELIVERY_URL: '',
        CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET: '',
     };
    module.exports = {
      TOKEN: TOKEN,
      cloudinaryInfo: cloudinaryInfo
    };
    ```

3. Run webpack in development with:

   > `yarn run watch`

4. Run server with:

   > `yarn run start`

5. Connect to domain matching serverURL in `client/src`
